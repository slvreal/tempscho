  <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
  <hr>

  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>
    Ada Lovelace was born in London on December 10, 1815. Her mother was Anne Isabella
    Milbanke, and her father was the poet George Gordon Byron. Her parents separated when she
    was very young; raised by her mother, she received a strong education in mathematics in the
    hope that Ada would grow up very different from her poet father. As a teen she befriended
    mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage, through whom she was able to begin studying
    advanced mathematics with a University of London professor. Ada married in 1835 and had
    three children. She died on November 27, 1852.

  <h2>Contributions to Computer Science</h2>
  <p>
    Ada’s contributions are best understood in the context of her friendship with Charles Babbage.
    After seeing his notes and his prototype for a “difference engine,” she became fascinated with
    an “analytical engine.”
  </p>
  <p>
    When asked to translate an article about the Analytical Engine, Ada produced a translation and
    added extensive notes of her own. Unlike Babbage, who mainly envisioned the machine as
    performing calculations, Ada described how it could follow an algorithm. In these notes she
    included an example that many consider the first computer program, nearly 100 years before a
    working computer was built.
